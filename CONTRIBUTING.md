# Contributing

Contributions are welcomed!

When contributing to this repository, please first discuss the change you wish to make via a GitHub
issue before making a change.  This saves everyone from wasted effort in the event that the proposed
changes need some adjustment before they are ready for submission.
All new code, including changes to existing code, should be tested and have a corresponding test added or updated where applicable.


## Prerequisites

The following must be installed on your development machine:

- `go`
- `docker`
- `openjdk-8` or another JDK
- `gcc` (or `build-essential` package on debian distributions)
- `kubectl`
- `dgoss`

`cassandra-operator` must be cloned to a location on your `$GOPATH`, for example `go/src/github.com/sky-uk/cassandra-operator/`.

## Building and Testing

To setup your environment with the required dependencies, run this at the project root level.
This will create a [Docker-in-Docker](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/kubeadm-dind-cluster/) cluster.
Missing system libraries that need installing will be listed in the output:

```
make setup
```

To run code style checks on all the sub-projects:

```
make check-style
```

To build and run all tests:
```
make
```

An end-to-end testing approach is used wherever possible.
The end-to-end tests are run in parallel in order to the reduce build time as much as possible.
The number of parallel tests is dictated by a hardcoded value in the end-to-end test suite, which has been chosen to reflect the namespace resource quota in AWS Dev.

End-to-end tests are by default run against a local [Docker-in-Docker](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/kubeadm-dind-cluster/) cluster using a [fake-cassandra-docker](fake-cassandra-docker/README.md) image to speed up testing.
However tests can also be run against a real Cassandra image as well as against your own cluster.

For instance, if you want to run a full build against your cluster with the default `cassandra:3.11` Cassandra image, use this:
```
USE_MOCK=false POD_START_TIMEOUT=5m DOMAIN=mydomain.com KUBE_CONTEXT=k8Context TEST_REGISTRY=myregistry.com/cassandra-operator-test make
```
... where the available flags are:

Flag | Meaning | Default
---|---|---
`USE_MOCK`                     | Whether the Cassandra pods created in the tests should use a `fake-cassandra-docker` image. If true, you can further specify which image to use via the `FAKE_CASSANDRA_IMAGE` flag | `true`
`CASSANDRA_BOOTSTRAPPER_IMAGE` | The fully qualified name for the `cassandra-bootstrapper` docker image | `$(TEST_REGISTRY)/cassandra-bootstrapper:v$(gitRev)`
`FAKE_CASSANDRA_IMAGE`         | The fully qualified name for the `fake-cassandra-docker` docker image | `$(TEST_REGISTRY)/fake-cassandra:v$(gitRev)`
`CASSANDRA_SNAPSHOT_IMAGE`     | The fully qualified name for the `cassandra-snapshot` docker image | `$(TEST_REGISTRY)/cassandra-snapshot:v$(gitRev)`
`CASSANDRA_SIDECAR_IMAGE`      | The fully qualified name for the `cassandra-sidecar` docker image | `$(TEST_REGISTRY)/cassandra-sidecar:v$(gitRev)`
`POD_START_TIMEOUT`            | The max duration allowed for a Cassandra pod to start. The time varies depending on whether a real or fake cassandra image is used and whether PVC or empty dir is used for the cassandra volumes. As a starting point use 120s for fake cassandra otherwise 5m | `120s`
`DOMAIN`                       | Domain name used to create the test operator ingress host | `localhost`
`KUBE_CONTEXT`                 | The Kubernetes context where the test operator will be deployed | `dind`
`TEST_REGISTRY`                | The name of the docker registry where test images created via the build will be pushed| `localhost:5000`
`DOCKER_USERNAME`              | The docker username allowed to push to the release registry | (provided as encrypted variable in `.travis.yml`)
`DOCKER_PASSWORD`              | The password for the docker username allowed to push to the release registry | (provided as encrypted variable in `.travis.yml`)
`GINKGO_COMPILERS`             | Ginkgo `-compilers` value to use when compiling multiple tests suite | `0`, equivalent to not setting the option at all
`GINKGO_NODES`                 | Ginkgo `-nodes` value to use when running tests suite in parallel | `0`, equivalent to not setting the option at all
`E2E_TEST`                     | Name of the end-to-end test suite to run. Use this to run a specific test suite | ``, equivalent to running all test suites 

## What to work on

If you want to get involved but are not sure on what issue to pick up,
you should look for an issue with a `good first issue` or `bug` label.

## Pull Request Process

1. If your changes include multiple commits, please squash them into a single commit.  Stack Overflow
   and various blogs can help with this process if you're not already familiar with it.
2. Update the README.md / WIKI where relevant.
3. When submitting your pull request, please provide a comment which describes the change and the problem
   it is intended to resolve. If your pull request is fixing something for which there is a related GitHub issue,
   make reference to that issue with the text "Closes #<issue-number>" in the pull request description.
4. You may merge the pull request to master once a reviewer has approved it. If you do not have permission to
   do that, you may request the reviewer to merge it for you.

## Pinning dependencies

Certain dependencies are picky about using exact combinations of package
versions (in particular, `k8s.io/client-go` and `k8s.io/apimachinery`).

The `cassandra-operator/hack/pin-dependency.sh` script is useful for managing
and pinning these versions when the time comes to update them.

For example, to pin both of these:

```bash
./hack/pin-dependency.sh k8s.io/apimachinery kubernetes-1.15.0-alpha.0
./hack/pin-dependency.sh k8s.io/client-go v11.0.0
```

## Releasing

Only maintainers would need to do this:
- Update the CHANGELOG.md with details of all the changes that have been merged since the last release
- Tag the master branch with a new version number; this will trigger a new build which will release
docker images labelled after the tag
- Publish the release (via github), referencing issues and contributors

This project follows the [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/) specification, and version numbers
should be chosen accordingly.
